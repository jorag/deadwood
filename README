A Python project for classification of forest structure (healthy vs. defoliated trees) using satellite remote sensing data. 

The primary data source is quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes. 
The added value of Sentinel-2 multispectral optical data is also studied.

Dependencies:
Python 3.4 (to be compatible with SNAPPY)
numpy (numeric computations, array handling, etc.)
GDAL 2.1.0 (reading GeoTIFF images)
tk 8.5.18 (tkinter for file dialouge)
pandas (for reading Excel/CSV ground-truth data files)
xlrd (requiered by pandas for reading Excel files)
scikit-learn 0.18.1 (for kNN and other Machine Learning methods)
